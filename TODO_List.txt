For next session:
1.Download and compile clang:
  https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html
  Use gcc 9.3.0
  You will need to download cmake (I think version 3.17â€¦)
2.Verify that clang is working well:
  Try clang (regular compile), and clang format.
3.Create a new area at github for our project and upload the code there.
Split into 2 folders, first is llvm-project which will contain the clang code with your changes, and second will contain your own files (like wrapper files).
4.Try to add some minimal change for the clang-format code and to see that it is working:
Print your name at the beginning and the end of the generated C++ code.
